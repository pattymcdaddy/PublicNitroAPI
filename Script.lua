local backendType = "Defualt" -- Please enter what backend you are using. Possible choices are: "Defualt", or "Other"
-- If you are using a self hosted backend or any other service, change the backendType to "Other", and supply the URL below. Further code alterations will be needed on lines 10 thru 100.

local URL = "N/A" -- I am not responsible for any negative actions used with your own custom backend. If you are using the defualt backend, leave this. If you are using a custom backend, also make sure you include a "/" on the end. Ex: "https://google.com/"

	-- Here's where you should insert your code after the player is a booster. In this case, we're having our Nitro Booster tag clone to our character. This function passes thru a player's instance.

	-- Now it's time to call for their DiscordID from their RobloxID. For this, I'm using Neztore's API, but you can use your own or even if you have a RoVer API key, RoVer's. (altho i couldn't find any proper documentation for the reverse api)
	-- You are expected to alter the code to fit your API of choice. However if you plan to leave it as defualt, no alterations are necessary for this to work.
